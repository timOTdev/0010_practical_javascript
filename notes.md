# Introduction
## What is Practical JavaScript?
- If you've been a victim of boring tutorials that never teach you how to build anything, help save someone from the same fate by sharing Practical JavaScript.
- Courses out there are not teaching you practical application of JavaScript
- Most courses only teach you syntax and features 
- For example, a writing course teaches you only grammar but doesn't force you to write
- Courses focuses on a single project and increases in difficulty

## The voice in your ear
- If you've experienced the struggle, take a second and help out by sharing Practical JavaScript.
- Gordon Zhu is founder at Watch and Code
- Studied business in college and does not have CS background
- Self-taught but initally had a lot of doubts
- Started with beginner resources but was frustrating
- Lots of tutorials were buggy or out of date
- There's a huge leap in logic with courses
- No one to ask for help even in the course

- Also useful intermediate/advance developers because helps fills in knowledge gaps
- We are focusing on plain javascript
- We are making a basic to do list application

## What you'll build
- We are going to build a to do list with plain JavaScript
- We are going to look at an outline of how we are building
- User Stories:
    1. You can add items
    2. Tells how many items you have left to do
    3. An all item complete button
    4. Delete button
    5. Clear completed button
    6. All, active, completed filter toggle

## The development process
- The ability to break apart features into bite-sized requirements is one of the most important skills you can learn. You'll see this kind of thinking throughout Practical JavaScript.
- There will be different versions that implement new code to improve our app
